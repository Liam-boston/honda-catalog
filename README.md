## Practice II 
### Description
For this assignment, you will be asked to develop an Android app that displays a list of items using ListView. The user should be able to click on an item to view its details in a separate activity. The app should use explicit intent to navigate between activities and pass information between them. When the user clicks on an item, a visual notification should be triggered, displaying the item's details in a Toast or Snackbar.

### Requirements
 + The app should have a main activity that displays a list of items using ListView. Each item should have a title and a subtitle.
 + The app should use a data model class to represent each item in the list.
 + The app should use an Adapter class to populate the ListView with the list items.
 + The app should implement an OnClickListener to handle clicks on the list items.
 + When the user clicks on an item, the app should use explicit intent to navigate to a second activity that displays the details of the item.
 + The second activity should receive the data model object for the clicked item as an intent extra.
 + The second activity should display the item's details, including the title, subtitle, and any other relevant information.
 + When the user returns to the main activity from the second activity, the app should display a Toast/Snackbar indicating that the operation occurred successfully.
